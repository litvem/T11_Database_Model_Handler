# **T11 - Database Model Handler**

## **Descripton**
This is a component that is part of the Dentistimo distributed system. More information about the whole system can be found [here](https://github.com/litvem/T11_Project_Documentation).

This component is connected to the Mongo database and it is the only component in this distributed system that will persist entries in it. It works in close collaboration with the [Booking validator](https://github.com/litvem/T11_Booking_Validator), receiving bookings for dental appointments to be saved in the database, and the [Web application](https://github.com/litvem/T11_Web_Application), publishing information about the dentist clinics. 


## **Responsibilities**

- Publish data about the dentist clinics, so that the web application can display their info on the website
- Persist new bookings in the database
    - Publish confirmation message if it was successful
    - Publish error message if it was unsuccessful

## Error-Handling
The Mosquitto broker is normally automatically running in the background after you install it. A common error is therefore, when trying to run the `mosquitto -c mosquitto.conf -v ` command, that it will say that an instance of the broker is already running, and the process will terminate. To fix this (on Windows), got to services and stop the Mosquitto broker from there, and try the command again.
